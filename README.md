# OWASP-5

This is cybersecurity themed course project regarding the University of Helsinki course Cyber Security Base (TKT20009).

The intention of this project is solely to create at least five web application risks listed on [OWASP](
https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) inside this template project, from which I will build a report.
