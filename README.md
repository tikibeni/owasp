# OWASP-5

This is cybersecurity themed course project regarding the University of Helsinki course Cyber Security Base (TKT20009).

The intention of this project is solely to create at least five web application risks listed on [OWASP](
https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) inside this template project, from which I will build a report.

## Installation guide

1. Clone:

```shell
   ~$ git clone git@github.com:tikibeni/owasp.git
   ~$ cd owasp
   ~/owasp$ 
```

3. Migrate & run:

```shell
   ~/owasp$ python manage.py migrate
   ~/owasp$ python manage.py runserver   
```
   
4. Open the app via browser. Localhost URL can be found from the console output.
